# ── Phase 1a: Contrastive skill distillation (successes + failures together) ─

CONTRASTIVE_DISTILLATION_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert physics analyst distilling agent behavior into concise, actionable skills.

**Environment**: 2D physics simulation (Box2D). Gravity = -9.8 m/s². World bounds [-5, 5] on both axes. The agent places a red ball at (x, y) with a given radius, then the simulation runs to completion.

**Level: {level_name}**
{level_description}

Below are SUCCESSFUL and FAILED trajectories from the same level. Each shows the agent's reasoning (Thought), actions taken, and simulation observations. Each trajectory has a **Reward** score:
- Successes: +1.0 (solved fast, 1-3 iters) to +0.25 (solved slowly, 16-25 iters)
- Failures: -0.5 (tried all iterations) to -0.75 (gave up early)

**Weight your analysis by reward** — skills from high-reward trajectories (fast solves) are more reliable than skills from low-reward ones (barely solved).

=== SUCCESSFUL TRAJECTORIES ({n_successes}) ===
{success_block}

=== FAILED TRAJECTORIES ({n_failures}) ===
{failure_block}

---

Your task: By CONTRASTING the successes and failures, extract the KEY PHYSICS SKILLS that distinguish solving from failing. Focus especially on high-reward successes — what insight let the agent solve it quickly? What did the failed agents miss?

For each skill, provide:
- **title**: Short name (3-7 words)
- **principle**: The physics insight (2-3 sentences). What mechanism was exploited? Why does it work?
- **when_to_apply**: Specific trigger condition (1 sentence)
- **source_seeds**: List of seed numbers from the trajectories above that this skill was primarily derived from. Include only the seeds whose behavior directly demonstrates or motivates this skill.

Output a JSON array:
```json
[
  {{
    "title": "...",
    "principle": "...",
    "when_to_apply": "...",
    "source_seeds": [1, 5, 16]
  }}

Extract 4-6 skills. Each should capture a DISTINCT insight from the success/failure contrast. Avoid redundancy.

# ── Phase 1b: Common mistakes extraction ───────────────────────────────

COMMON_MISTAKES_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert at analyzing agent failures and distilling them into avoidable mistake patterns.

**Environment**: 2D physics simulation (Box2D). Gravity = -9.8 m/s². World bounds [-5, 5].

Below are FAILED trajectories. Each shows the agent's reasoning, actions, and simulation results.

Your task has TWO parts:

**Part 1 — Mistakes**: Identify the COMMON MISTAKE PATTERNS across these failures. For each mistake, analyze:
1. What exactly the agent did wrong
2. WHY the agent made this error (what broken causal belief led to it)
3. A concrete actionable fix

**Part 2 — Partial insights**: Even in failed trajectories, some individual steps show CORRECT physics reasoning or useful discoveries (e.g., the agent found a valid placement region but then abandoned it, or correctly identified a mechanism but applied it with wrong parameters). Extract 1-2 skills from these "good steps within bad trajectories". These should be genuine physics insights, not just restating what went wrong.

Format as JSON object with two arrays:
```json
{{
  "mistakes": [
    {{
      "description": "What the mistake is (1 sentence)",
      "why_it_happens": "The broken belief or reasoning error that causes this (1 sentence)",
      "how_to_avoid": "Concrete actionable fix — what to do instead (1-2 sentences)"

      "source_seeds": [5, 11]
    }}
  ]

Extract 3-5 mistakes and 1-2 partial skills. For mistakes, group similar failures into one and focus on ROOT CAUSES. For partial skills, only extract genuinely useful insights — do not force it if no good steps exist.
